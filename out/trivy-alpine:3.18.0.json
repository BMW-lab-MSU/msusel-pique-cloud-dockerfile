          "Description": "Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and\ninitialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.",

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.",

We are currently unaware of any such applications.\n\nThe AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated\ndata entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the\napplication has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with\nNULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length.\nThe AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call\ninstead of performing the associated data authentication operation.\nThe empty data thus will not be authenticated.\n\nAs this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and\nwe expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data\nentries this is qualified as Low severity issue.",

          "Description": "Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and\ninitialisation vector (IV) lengths.  This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious. For these reasons we have assessed this\nissue as Moderate severity overall.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this because\nthe issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.",

OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing\nCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\nan overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the \"-check\" option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.",
